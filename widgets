# Widgets are building blocks of the kivy GUI
# the responsibility of widgets is to take event as an input and provide an appropriate response to it

# Event happened on widgets and widgets respond accordingly
# Event ----> widgets ----> Response

# The event in widgets can be of two types
#     -Property Event
#     -Widget-Defined Event
